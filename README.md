# UNR NVIM

Unr got fed up with nvchad, and decided to do it himself.

It might be all hand written, but it wasn't hand thoughten.



## TODO

- [ ] Reimplement floating terminal (for some reason pressing enter open/closed it)
- [ ] Figure out _what the actual fuck_ is going on with treesitter parsing
- [ ] Investigate using null-ls again?
- [ ] Need autoformatters for vue, make sure prettier and things are running.
- [ ] Setup Whichkey
- [ ] Tinker with noice until I'm satisfied
- [ ] Somehow steal pretty telescope from NVChad
